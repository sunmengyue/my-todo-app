- You can [click here](https://task-slayer-70909.herokuapp.com/) to see the app demo
- I am teaching myself front-end web development and now my main focus is React.
- Through building this app, I have a better understanding of React Hooks and responsive web-development.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The original [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hH6PbOHBdPm6otzw2De5) was to build an application to complete the given user stories. This app modifies several features. Now you can use this app to:

- Create a new task
- Switch between all tasks, active tasks, and completed tasks
- Delete a task under either tab of all, active, and completed tasks
- Edit an existing task under all and active tab
- Store data in local storage so that tasks can still be seen when the page gets refreshed

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/sunmengyue/my-todo-app.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

Notice that The branch I finally deployed is **pureHTMLCss**.
